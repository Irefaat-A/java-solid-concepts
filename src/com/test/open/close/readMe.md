# **Open and Close**

**Open for extension** 

Let's create a new class called Guitar. Give it a few properties and getters and setters.
If a new cool requirement comes along that require you to add cool colours to a guitar.
Best Create a new class SuperCoolGuitar and extend it with Guitar class. You wont break existing code and makes debugging easier.

**Close to modification**

Your new SuperCoolGuitar class extend Guitar class and inherits Guitar properties. Which means whenever new requirements comes along you will only extend Guitar class which makes it closed to modification.
